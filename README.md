	Titan Panel [GuildLight]: A simple guild list for the Titan Panel AddOn.
        created by dornonville 2025, with heavy inspiration from the Titan Panel [Guild] addon by chicogrande (2005) 
        and Kernighan/Yunohu (2012-2019)
		
	- Lists guild members in a tooltip
	- Menu shows names of members
	- Shows default messages if the player is not a member of a guild
	- Menu has option to toggle show offline members - online members are shown in the top
	- Filtering on classes 
	- NO Paging for now, so the mouseover list with guild members can roll out of the screen
